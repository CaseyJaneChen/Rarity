# Rarity
The Python package generated for the following academic paper:

Alexander, C. and Chen, X. Rarity Metrics for Non-Fungible Token Collections. 

Given any collection address, the package downloads the metadata and computes different rarity scores and rankings (w/o padding or trait normalization), checks for trait independence, and generates informative new types of visual tools.
